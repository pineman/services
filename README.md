Migrate pinecone (and homelab in general) to kubernetes.
## TODO
1. Unify storage service (~/Documents and pvcs for pods)
1. Keep a KVM host for experiments somehow
## Notes
Its a lot of unneeded work for the usecase, but side projects are for over-engineering and learning (:
The main goal is to have everything as immutable as possible.
